# Blog Dashboard with Next.js + RTK Query

A simple blog dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, Material UI, and Redux Toolkit (RTK Query). It supports server-side rendering, dynamic routing, creating new posts, and mock API integration.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-dashboard.git
cd blog-dashboard
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

### 3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Next.js** â€“ Framework for SSR and routing
- **TypeScript** â€“ Static type checking
- **Material UI (MUI)** â€“ Component library for styling
- **Redux Toolkit + RTK Query** â€“ API state management
- **MockAPI** â€“ Mock backend for development/testing

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions & Challenges

### Pagination & Total Count

- **Challenge:** `mockapi.io` supports pagination but doesnâ€™t always include the `X-Total-Count` header needed for showing total pages.
- **Decision:** We used `transformResponse` in RTK Query to extract this header when available, and fallback to `.length` when it's not.

### Consistent Card Height

- **Challenge:** When displaying post cards in a grid, differing content lengths caused inconsistent card heights.
- **Solution:** Used Flexbox and limited the post body to two lines using `lineClamp`, ensuring visual consistency.

### Form Reusability

- **Challenge:** Managing forms for both create and edit functionality.
- **Decision:** Built a reusable `PostForm` component integrated with `react-hook-form` for cleaner state handling and validation.

## ðŸ“¦ Mock API

We're using [MockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io) to simulate backend data. You can find the projectâ€™s API endpoint here:
