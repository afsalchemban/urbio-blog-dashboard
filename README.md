# Blog Dashboard with Next.js + RTK Query

A simple blog dashboard built with Next.js, TypeScript, Material UI, and Redux Toolkit (RTK Query). It supports server-side rendering, dynamic routing, creating new posts, and mock API integration.

ðŸš€ **Live Demo**

This project is deployed and available at: [urbio-blog-dashboard.vercel.app](https://urbio-blog-dashboard.vercel.app/)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Next.js** â€“ Framework for SSR and routing
- **TypeScript** â€“ Static type checking
- **Material UI (MUI)** â€“ Component library for styling
- **Redux Toolkit + RTK Query** â€“ API state management
- **MockAPI** â€“ Mock backend for development/testing

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions & Challenges

### SSR vs. SSG

- **Decision:** I had to choose between SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation). SSR was chosen because blog content can change frequently, and we want users to always see the most up-to-date content when they visit the page.

### Add New Post 

- **Challenge:** Ensuring that the modal form state reset correctly after each use and that the list updated immediately after adding a post.
- **Decision:** The "Add New Post" functionality was implemented using a dialog modal to provide a smoother and more seamless user experience without navigating away from the list view.I used RTK Query's caching and automatic refetching features to keep the post list updated without requiring manual refreshes, providing better UX and consistency.


### Pagination & Total Count

- **Challenge:** `mockapi.io` supports pagination but doesnâ€™t always include the `X-Total-Count` header needed for showing total pages.
- **Decision:** We used `transformResponse` in RTK Query to extract this header when available, and fallback to `.length` when it's not.

### Consistent Card Height & Body Display

- **Challenge:** When displaying post cards in a grid, differing content lengths caused inconsistent card heights.
- **Solution:** Used Flexbox for layout and enforced a consistent two-line body preview using CSS `lineClamp` to maintain uniformity.

### Form Reusability

- **Challenge:** Managing forms for both create and edit functionality.
- **Decision:** Built a reusable `PostForm` component integrated with `react-hook-form` for cleaner state handling and validation.

## ðŸ“¦ Mock API

We're using [MockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io) to simulate backend data. You can find the projectâ€™s API endpoint here:
